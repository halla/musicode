Generating sound and music programmatically.


I'm taking the Coursera course Introduction to Programming for Musicians and Digital Artists (https://www.coursera.org/course/chuck101).


I'll start by putting my course assignments here (but only after the results for the week are out).


You can listen to these in my SoundCloud https://soundcloud.com/antti-halla
